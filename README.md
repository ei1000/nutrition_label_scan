# nutrition_label_scan
Want to learn how to scrape the nutritional information of a product. Maybe use that information in other projects and make a database for local food, that is not common.

To solve this I have tried different approaches. 

For pre proccessing im relying on a paper for doing this task, but I will try a different approach on the scraping if possible.
